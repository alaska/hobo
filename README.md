This is where I keep simple vagrant configurations I use for local development and testing. You might find them useful. Or not.

## Use

`$ vagrant up`

## Warning

These images are intended for local development only. Hence the `config.vm.network "private_network"`. I cannot stress enough that these images are **COMPLETELY INSECURE** by design, because they're for testing and mocking up and are not intended for production use. For srs.
